# Speech Denoising with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs)

This project explores the application of **spiking neural networks (SNNs)** for **speech denoising**, aiming to improve the quality of speech signals in noisy environments.

## Introduction

Speech denoising is a key challenge in many applications, from voice assistants to hearing aids. Conventional methods like deep neural networks (DNNs) and traditional filtering algorithms often face limitations in highly dynamic or non-stationary noise environments. Spiking neural networks, which more closely mimic the brainâ€™s neural activity, offer a promising solution by leveraging temporal patterns in signals.

This project investigates the potential of SNNs for speech denoising by utilizing their ability to process time-sensitive information efficiently and reduce noise in a way that preserves the integrity of the original speech signal.

## Problem Statement

In real-world scenarios, speech signals are often contaminated with noise due to factors like background chatter, wind, or equipment interference. These noisy signals can affect the performance of speech recognition systems and hinder clear communication. The aim of this project is to design a system using SNNs that can effectively denoise speech signals and enhance their quality for further processing.

## Approach

1. **Modeling the Speech Signal**:
   The speech signal is transformed into a form suitable for processing by an SNN. This includes encoding the speech data into spike trains that can be input to the network.
   
2. **Network Architecture**:
   A spiking neural network architecture is developed, incorporating a variety of neuron models and synaptic connections that allow the network to process and filter noise over time.
   
3. **Training the Network**:
   The SNN is trained using a dataset of noisy speech signals, with the objective of minimizing the noise while preserving the speech characteristics. Techniques like spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) and supervised learning are explored.

4. **Evaluation**:
   The performance of the model is evaluated by comparing the denoised output with the original clean speech signal using metrics such as **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and subjective listening tests.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of **noisy speech** samples with various background noises, such as traffic, office chatter, and environmental sounds. The clean speech data was sourced from publicly available speech corpora like **LibriSpeech**.

- **Noisy Speech**: Audio recordings with added background noise.
- **Clean Speech**: Original speech samples without noise contamination.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need Python and a few dependencies. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or PyTorch) for neural network training
- NumPy and SciPy for data processing
- Matplotlib for visualizations
- Librosa for audio processing

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/speech-denoising-snn.git
   cd speech-denoising-snn
   ```

2. Preprocess your audio files:
   The preprocessing script converts audio files into spectrograms or spike trains compatible with the SNN model.

   ```bash
   python preprocess.py --input /path/to/audio --output /path/to/processed_data
   ```

3. Train the model:
   To start training the model, use the following command:

   ```bash
   python train.py --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
   ```

4. Evaluate the model:
   Once training is complete, use the evaluation script to assess the performance of the model.

   ```bash
   python evaluate.py --model /path/to/trained_model --test_data /path/to/test_data
   ```

5. Denoise a new speech sample:
   ```bash
   python denoise.py --input noisy_speech.wav --output denoised_speech.wav
   ```

## Results

The model has been evaluated on several noisy speech samples, and the results show a significant improvement in speech clarity. Key metrics:

- **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: Improved by X dB after denoising.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Reduced by Y%.
- **Subjective Evaluation**: Listeners reported a clearer and more intelligible speech signal.

## Contributions

- **Spiking Neural Network Architecture**: Developed and implemented an SNN-based model for speech denoising.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Collected and preprocessed noisy speech data for training.
- **Evaluation**: Thorough evaluation of the model's performance in both objective metrics and subjective listening tests.

## Future Work

- Experimenting with **different SNN architectures** to improve denoising performance.
- Implementing real-time speech denoising for live applications.
- Extending the system to handle more complex background noise scenarios.
